Here is the project I did with Consilio over the course of my six week internship.

The goal of this project was to develop a Next Gen OCR prototype that is comparable to current systems. 
While the final results of the project did not indicate that vision language models outperform current OCR systems like Tesseract, Phi-3-Vision was close with no fine tuning involved.
The other major note was that Phi-3-Vision was more searchable than Tesseract was, as it dropped fewer words and had errant spacing less often than Tesseract, which is an important takeaway for the eDsicovery industry.
Phi-3.5-Vision was released shortly before this internship ended, and I was not able to get that model to consistently perform at a high level in a short amount of time.
